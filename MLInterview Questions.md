## What are the parameters in training a decision tree ?
- **max_depth** : This indicates how deep the tree can be. The deeper the tree, the more splits it has and it captures more information about the data.
- **min_samples_split** : min_samples_split represents the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.
- **min_samples_leaf**: min_samples_leaf is The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. 
- **max_features** : max_features represents the number of features to consider when looking for the best split.

## What are the criteria for splitting at a node in decision trees ?
- **CART (Classification and Regression Trees)** → uses Gini Index(Classification) as metric.
- **ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3)** → uses Entropy function and Information gain as metrics.

## What is the formula of Gini index criteria?
## What is the formula for Entropy criteria?
## How is it decided that on which features it has to split ?
## How do you calculate information gain mathematically ?
