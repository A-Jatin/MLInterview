# Machine Learning & Data Science Interview

> When you cease to dream, you cease to live.

**NOTE** : Start with probability, move to distributions, and then tackle inference and prediction. Youâ€™ll have an easier time, I promise.

I've found four main categories to study:

* Machine Learning
* Statistics & Probability
* Other Relevant Mathematics
* Programming
  - Concepts for quiz-like questions
  - Practicals for interview coding sessions
