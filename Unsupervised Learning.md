# Unsupervised Learning

## What is unsupervised Learning? </br>
Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output variables.

## What is clustering?</br>
It's an machine learning technique which segregate the various data points into different groups called clusters such that
entities in a particular group comparatively have more similar traits than entities in another group.

## Top 5 Clustering Algorithms to know

  - K-Means Clustering
  - Mean-Shift Clustering
  - Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)
  - Expectationâ€“Maximization (EM) Clustering using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
  - Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
