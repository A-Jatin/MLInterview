# Unsupervised Learning

## What is unsupervised Learning? </br>
Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output variables.

## What is clustering?</br>
It's an machine learning technique which segregate the various data points into different groups called clusters such that
entities in a particular group comparatively have more similar traits than entities in another group.

## Top 5 Clustering Algorithms to know

  - K-Means Clustering
  - Mean-Shift Clustering
  - Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)
  - Expectationâ€“Maximization (EM) Clustering using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
  - Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering

## K- means Clustering ?
k-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.

## Determining The Optimal Number Of Clusters: 3 Must Know Methods?
- Elbow method
- Average silhouette method
- Gap statistic method

## Principal Component Analysis
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimension reduction technique that projects
the data into a lower dimensional space
* PCA uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which is a matrix factorization method
that decomposes a matrix into three smaller matrices (more details of SVD [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular-value_decomposition))
* PCA finds top N principal components, which are dimensions along which the data vary
(spread out) the most. Intuitively, the more spread out the data along a specific dimension,
the more information is contained, thus the more important this dimension is for the
pattern recognition of the dataset
* PCA can be used as pre-step for data visualization: reducing high dimensional data
into 2D or 3D. An alternative dimensionality reduction technique is [t-SNE](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/)
