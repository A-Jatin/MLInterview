# Statistics Interview Questions for Data Science

**Population** : The entire group one desires information about.<br>
**Sample** : A subset of the population taken because the entire population is usually too large to analyze. It's 
characteristics are taken to be representative of the population.</br>
**Mean** : The sum of all the values in the sample divided by the number of values in the sample/population.</br>
**Median** : The median is the value separating the higher half of a data sample from the lower half.</br>
**Standard Deviation** : Square root of the variance. It measures the dispersion around the mean.</br>

## Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing in statistics is a way for you to test the results of a survey or experiment to see if you have meaningful results. <br>
Hypothesis testing steps:

* Figure out your null hypothesis,
* State your null hypothesis,
* Choose what kind of test you need to perform,
* Either support or reject the null hypothesis.

## Significance Level

The significance level α is the probability of making the wrong decision when the null hypothesis is true. Alpha levels (sometimes just called “significance levels”) are used in hypothesis tests. Usually, these tests are run with an alpha level of .05 (5%), but other levels commonly used are .01 and .10.

## P-value

A p value is used in hypothesis testing to help you support or reject the null hypothesis. The p value is the evidence against a null hypothesis. The smaller the p-value, the strong the evidence that you should reject the null hypothesis.

## A/B testing

A statistical way of comparing two (or more) techniques, typically an incumbent against a new rival. A/B testing aims to determine not only which technique performs better but also to understand whether the difference is statistically significant. A/B testing usually considers only two techniques using one measurement, but it can be applied to any finite number of techniques and measures.
